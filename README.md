- 👋 Hi, I’m @quarkjuggler. I spent 40 years as a Sys38/AS400/iSeries programmer and thought I was pretty hot.  Well, not! Linux is a much tougher nut to crack!
 
- 👀 besides programming, I'm interested in religion (gnosis), piano music (Alkan, Liszt, Chopin), electronics (chip-level), and building functional mechanical things.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning bash, python, nodejs, visual studio code, SQL, HTML5, css, . I hope to learn react and C++. --What am I saying?? I'm currently learning github!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on someday starting a business, but for now, I'm trying to prepare my Raspberry Pi for that journey. --Programming standards? backup scheme? Project management? Security? --Need to learh the ssh, if I can ever afford a second pi.  I'm assuming I shall use blueseer to manufacture the "Telulator".

- 💞️ To contact me, Call 361-332-3422 and ask for "John".

- 💞️ I'm married. She handles all the finances. I hope to help out by getting a job as a security-minded linux administrator.
